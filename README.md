# Procedurally-Generated-2D-Game-World---Java-Game-Engine

**Description:**

A Java-based procedural game world generator that dynamically creates terrain, weather conditions, and environmental elements in a 2D game world. The system manages character interactions, environmental behaviors, and object-oriented modeling of in-game entities.

**Technologies Used:**

Java

OOP Principles

Event-Driven Programming

Procedural World Generation

Game Physics and Interactions

**Features:**

Dynamic Terrain Generation: Creates landscapes, trees, clouds, and other natural elements procedurally.

Weather System: Includes features such as rain, sun movement, and night cycles.

Character Interaction: Avatar movement, jumping mechanics, and environmental interactions.

Energy Management: Implements energy usage and depletion mechanics for in-game elements.

Custom Game Objects: Blocks, trees, fruits, and other interactable game components.

Event Handling: Listens to and responds to various in-game events dynamically.
